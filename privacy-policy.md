# 4321 Todo Extension Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to actions of users of the 4321 Todo Chrome Extension (herafter "the extension", "4321").

## How we collect data

The extension does not collect any personal information. You are not required to register any details to start using the extension. 

The only data stored is the items that you add to the todo list. These are stored using Google's [chrome.storage API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/). The makers of 4321 do not have access to this data. Where this data is synced to your Google account, this is done over a secure connection using the API.

## Where is data stored

Full information on how and where the extension data is stored can be found in Google's [API documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/), with more information on their [Privacy Policy website](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US).

## Changes to this policy

We reserve the right to change this policy as we deem necessary, alongside the further development of the extension. All changes will be made immediately to this document.
